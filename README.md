## Work Experience

## Projects
**Predicting Nashik Weather**

The goal of this project is to predict the Weather condition of Nashik which is a multi-class classification problem.
- The classes are Sunny ‚òÄÔ∏è, Rainy üåßÔ∏è or partly cloudy day ‚òÅÔ∏è.
- In this project, I've imported the data, explored it and build a model and experiment with a few different hyperparameters.

**Predicting age of Abalone**

The goal of this project is to predict the age of Abalone given features and this is a Regression problem.
- In this project, I've imported and explored the data and built few models and compared the performance of each
- I've also used Optuna to tune hyperparameters.

**Heart disease prediction**

This project was built as a part of the ZTM course - "Complete AI, ML and DS Bootcamp".
- While building this project, I learnt the structure and process to follow to build any ML project.
